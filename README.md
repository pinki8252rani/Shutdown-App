# Shutdown-App
This project provides a simple GUI application for performing system power operations. It creates a window with four buttons for restarting, restarting with a delay, logging out, and shutting down the computer. The actions are executed using system commands. Note that this script is intended to be run on Windows, as the shutdown commands are specific to Windows systems.
